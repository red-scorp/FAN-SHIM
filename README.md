# FAN-SHIM project

FAN-SHIM (mini-HAT), support board for axial fans to cool Raspberry Pi.

Some Pis not require cooling because their CPUs are running in low performance mode.
Some Pis are good with simple passive heat sinks alone.
It's generally recommended to use active coolers, specially if you run Pi's CPU over-clocked.

This boards are designed to be used with standard axial funs with Pi's "Dupont" and standard PC's "Molex" connectors.
